# Template

This is a project template. To use it, click on [Use this template](/generate), select `KopfLab` as the owner (you can transfer it to your account at any point when it's ready to be made public), give it an informative `Repository name` that starts with your initials, and select `Private` to keep the data and analyses within the lab until they are ready for publication. Then hit `Create repository from template` and wait a few seconds for the repository to get generated. In your brand new repository, hit the `Clone or download` button, and then `Open in Desktop` to synchronize the new repository with your own computer via [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (you can also do this by command-line if you're familiar with Git).
